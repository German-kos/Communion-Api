# Communion API

Currently rewriting the api with clean architecture in mind: https://github.com/German-kos/Communion-Api-Clean_Rewrite

This API was build for the Communion Forum.
It will control and manage the users, categories, threads, and profiles of the project.
readme will be updated later on in the project.
